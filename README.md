# Portfolio Website  

## 🚀 Overview  
A personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information as a front-end developer. The site is clean, responsive, and designed to make a strong first impression on potential clients and employers.  

## 🛑 Problem  
I needed a professional way to present myself online. GitHub alone didn’t highlight my design skills or demonstrate how I build real-world web applications.  

## 💡 Solution  
I designed and developed a portfolio website with smooth navigation, responsive layouts, and a modern UI. The website includes sections for About, Projects, and Contact, along with animations to improve the user experience.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- React  
- React Router  
- Tailwind CSS  
- GitHub Pages (deployment)
